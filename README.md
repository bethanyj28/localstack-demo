# localstack-demo
A toy project to demonstrate how to use [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) in practice.

## Quickstart
To run the completed app, simply run `make up`. From there, you can hit `http://localhost:8080/greeting` with something that looks like:
```
{
  "name": "Bethany"
}
```
and then `http://localhost:8080/greeting/Bethany` to get the greeting.

## Demo follow-along
To follow along with the demo, checkout the `start-here` branch.
