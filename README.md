# localstack-demo

## Quickstart
To run the completed app, simply run `make up`. From there, you can hit `http://localhost:8080/greeting` with something that looks like:
```
{
  "name": "Bethany"
}
```
and then `http://localhost:8080/greeting/Bethany` to get the greeting.

## Demo follow-along
To follow along with the demo, checkout the `01-start` branch. We'll be going in this order:
```
01-start
02-docker-setup
03-aws-config
```
